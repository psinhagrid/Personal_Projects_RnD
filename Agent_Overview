LangChain Framework Integration
Our implementation heavily relies on the LangChain framework, specifically the langchain-openai library for seamless OpenAI integration. 
LangChain provides us with a structured approach to building complex AI applications through its chain-based architecture. 
We utilize SystemMessage and HumanMessage classes to create properly formatted prompts that maintain context and ensure consistent communication with the AI models.
The framework's modular design allows us to build sophisticated processing pipelines where each component handles a specific aspect of the request-response cycle. 
This includes intent analysis, ambiguity detection, response generation, and error handling. 
The chain-based approach ensures that data flows logically through each processing stage while maintaining the ability to branch into different workflows based on the analysis results.

Core Agents and Their Functions
Intent Analysis Agent
The Intent Analysis Agent serves as the first point of contact for all incoming queries. This agent's primary responsibility is to parse and understand what specific information the user is seeking. It examines the question structure, identifies the main subject or entity being discussed, extracts the specific attributes or information being requested, and recognizes any qualifiers or conditions that might affect the response.
The agent works by breaking down complex questions into their component parts, analyzing the linguistic structure to understand the user's true intent. For example, when asked "What's the status of the big project?", the agent identifies that the user wants status information about a project, but notes that "big project" is a subjective descriptor that requires clarification. This analysis forms the foundation for all subsequent processing steps.
Ambiguity Detection Agent
The Ambiguity Detection Agent represents the most sophisticated component of our system. This agent applies a comprehensive set of decision rules to determine whether a question can be answered directly from the available context or requires additional clarification. The agent operates on a three-tier confidence system: HIGH, MEDIUM, and LOW, which helps determine the appropriate response strategy.
The agent identifies ambiguous queries through several key patterns. It flags questions that use vague references like "the project", "big project", or "main initiative" when multiple entities exist in the context. It also detects when questions use descriptive terms without specific names, such as referring to a "major project" or "primary system" without clearly identifying which one. The agent is particularly effective at recognizing when context mentions multiple items but the question doesn't specify which one by exact name.
Conversely, the agent confidently processes unambiguous queries where questions specifically name the entity being asked about, where only one relevant entity exists in the context, or where the context contains direct statements that answer the question without interpretation. The sophisticated rule-based logic ensures that users receive direct answers when possible while preventing incorrect assumptions when clarity is needed.
Clarification Generation Agent
When the Ambiguity Detection Agent identifies unclear queries, the Clarification Generation Agent takes over to create helpful and constructive responses. Rather than simply stating that a question cannot be answered, this agent crafts responses that acknowledge what information is available, explain why the question cannot be answered definitively, and ask specific clarifying questions to help resolve the ambiguity.
The agent generates natural, conversational responses that guide users toward providing the additional information needed. For instance, if asked about "the main system" when multiple systems exist, the agent might respond: "I can see information about several systems in the context: a Payment system ($100K), Security system ($200K), and Analytics system ($150K). Could you please specify which system you're asking about?" This approach maintains a helpful tone while efficiently gathering the necessary details.
Direct Answer Agent
The Direct Answer Agent handles queries that have been determined to be unambiguous and can be answered directly from the available context. This agent focuses on providing clear, concise, and factual responses based solely on the information provided. It maintains strict adherence to the source material, avoiding speculation or inference beyond what is explicitly stated.
The agent formats responses to be immediately useful, often referencing the source information to provide context and credibility. When answering "When did the Odyssey project start?" with context stating "The Odyssey project started in 2023," the agent provides a direct response while maintaining traceability to the source information.

Development Environment and Tools
Our development environment is built on a foundation of carefully selected Python libraries and tools. The core dependency stack includes langchain-openai for AI model integration, langchain-core for fundamental LangChain functionality, pydantic for data validation and serialization, and requests for HTTP connectivity testing. This combination provides both the AI capabilities we need and the robust data handling required for enterprise applications.
Configuration management follows enterprise best practices with API keys stored as environment variables and runtime model switching capabilities built into the system. The architecture supports both programmatic integration and interactive command-line usage, making it suitable for both automated processing and human-in-the-loop workflows.
